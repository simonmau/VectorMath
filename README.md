# VectorMath
A implementation of double-vector-math with vector2 &amp; vector3, written to perform well for high-perf-applications

### Why does this exist?
Most implementations of Vectors work with arrays in the background, which makes them perform quite poorly<br/>
This implementation uses structs which makes the code a bit more ugly but much better perfoming, its a compromise.
